            <h2>GURU IMPEX</h2>
            <p>
                MID House of Diamonds is one of the world`s largest and most respected manufacturers and distributors of
                polished diamonds, supplying leading jewelry retailers from around the world with a full range of
                supply. While the company is today counted globally among the top-10 polished diamond suppliers, we
                remain a family business in approach and temperament, committed to our founding principles of mutual
                respect, excellence and dedicated personal service.
            </p>
            <p>
                MID House of Diamonds is a company that never sleeps. With offices in eight diamond and jewelry centers,
                circling the globe, we have the infrastructure and resources that enable us to provide large,
                medium-sized and small specialty retailers with inventory that meets each one’s needs at any point in
                time. Through our international network of factories and offices, we are able to maintain close personal
                relationships with all our clients, offering diamonds of every shape, size and color, from sizes as
                small as 10 points to diamonds of 10 carats and more, both as individual stones and in bulk.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every diamond that we deliver carries with it our firm’s commitment to defend the ethical integrity of
                the chain of supply, from the mine to the marketplace. MID House of Diamonds is a proud member of the
                Responsible Jewellery Council and has been audited and certified to ensure that we are fully in
                compliance with the RJC Code of Practices.
